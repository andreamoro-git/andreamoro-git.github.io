                  We test the implications of a statistical discrimination model with asymmetric learning. Firms receive signals of productivity over time and may use race to infer worker’s productivity. Incumbent employers have more information about workers productivity than outside employers. Using data from the NLSY79, we find evidence of asymmetric learning. In addition, employers statistically discriminate against non-college educated black workers at time of hiring. We also find that employers directly observe most of the productivity of college graduates at hiring, and learn very little over time about these workers.

                  We study a general class of models with social interactions that might display multiple equilibria. We
                  propose an estimation procedure for these models and evaluate its efficiency and computational
                  feasibility relative to different approaches taken to the curse of dimensionality implied
                  by the multiplicity. Using data on smoking among teenagers, we implement the proposed
                  estimation procedure to understand how group interactions affect health-related choices.
                  Wefind that interaction effects are strong both at the school level and at the smaller
                  friends-network level. Multiplicity of equilibria is pervasive at the estimated parameter
                  values, and equilibrium selection accounts for about 15 percent of the observed smoking
                  behavior. Counterfactuals show that student interactions, surprisingly, reduce smoking
                  by approximately 70 percent with respect to the equilibrium smoking that would occur
                  without interactions.

                  We investigate the effects of female executives on gender-specific wage distributions and firm performance.
                  We find that female leadership has a positive impact at the top of the female wage
                  distribution and a negative impact at the bottom. Moreover, the impact of female leadership
                  on firm performance increases with the share of female workers. Our empirical strategy
                  accounts for the endogeneity induced by the non-random assignment of executives to
                  firms by including in the regressions firm fixed effects, by generating controls from
                  a two-way fixed effects regression, and by building instruments based on regional trends.
                  The empirical findings are consistent with a model of statistical dis- crimination
                  where female executives are better equipped at interpreting signals of productivity
                  from female workers. The evidence suggests substantial costs of under-representation
                  of women at the top of the corporate hierarchy.

                  acquire skills that are imperfectly observed by firms, who therefore use aggregate
                  country investment as the prior when evaluating workers. This creates an informational
                  externality interacting with general equilibrium effects on each country's skill premium.
                  Asymmetric equilibria with comparative advantages exist even when there is a unique
                  equilibrium under autarky. Symmetric, no-trade equilibria may be unstable under free
                  trade. Welfare effects are ambiguous: trade may be Pareto improving even if it leads
                  to an equilibrium with rich and poor countries, with no special advantage to country
                  size.

                   We estimate the effects of obesity on wages accounting for the endogenous selection of workers into jobs requiring different levels of personal interactions in the workplace. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 combined with detailed information about occupation characteristics from O*Net, we confirm the results from the literature finding a wage penalty for obese white women. This penalty is higher in jobs that require a high level of personal interactions. Accounting for job selection does not significantly change the estimated wage penalty.

                  where jobs are characterized by wages and work-hours exibility. Flexibility is valued
                  by workers, and is costly to provide for employers. The model generates observed wage
                  distributions directly related to the preference for exibility parameters: the higher
                  the preference for exibility, the wider is the support of the wage distribution at
                  exible jobs and the larger is the discontinuity between the wage distribution at exible
                  and non- exible jobs. Results show that more than one third of women place positive
                  value to exibility, and that reducing the cost of exibility may considerably reduce
                  the gender wage gap.

                  <div class="title">Abstract</div> Statistical discrimination is a theory of inequality between demographic
                  groups based on stereotypes that do not arise from prejudice or racial and gender bias.When
                  rational, information-seeking decision makers use aggregate group characteristics,
                  such as group averages, to evaluate individual personal characteristics, individuals
                  belonging to different groups may be treated differently even if they share identical
                  observable characteristics in every other aspect. Discrimination can be the agents’
                  efficient response to asymmetric beliefs, or discriminatory outcomes may display an
                  element of inefficiency: the disadvantaged group could perform better if beliefs were
                  not asymmetric across groups (but beliefs are asymmetric because the disadvantaged
                  are not performing as well as the dominant group)

                  This paper explores the ability of pivotal-voter models to explain voter behavior in small-scale elections
                  using data from Texas liquor referenda. The findings provide little support for the
                  view that pivotal-voter models are a reasonable theory for understanding small-scale
                  elections. Interestingly, this is not because they cannot explain the levels of turnout
                  in the data, but rather because they cannot explain the size of the winning margins.
                  The logic of pivotal-voter models implies that elections must be expected to be close
                  even if there is a significant difference between the sizes of the groups or the intensity
                  of their preferences. With even a relatively small number of eligible voters, elections
                  that are expected to be close ex ante must end up being close ex post. However, in
                  the data, winning margins are often significant.

                  <div class="title">Abstract</div> Since 1914, the U.S. Senate has been elected and incumbent senators
                  allowed to run for reelection without limit. This differs from several other elected
                  offices in the U.S., which impose term limits on incumbents. Term limits may harm the
                  electorate if tenure is beneficial or if they force high quality candidates to retire
                  but may also benefit the electorate if they cause higher quality candidates to run.
                  We investigate how changes in electoral design affect voter utility by specifying and
                  structurally estimating a dynamic model of voter decisions. We find that tenure effects
                  for the U.S. Senate are negative or small and that incumbents face weaker challengers
                  than candidates running for open seats. Because of this, term limits can significantly
                  increase voter welfare.

                  exist? According to a standard textbook argument, a Pareto improvement can be obtained
                  by eliminating the distortions, compensating the losers with a lump sum transfer and
                  redistributing the gains that are left over. We relax the assumption that winners know
                  the losses suffered by the losers and show that the informationally efficient method
                  of compensating losers may involve the use of seemingly inefficient (but informationally
                  efficient) distortionary policies. The risk of over-compensating losers may make distortions
                  informationally efficient.

                  rationalizing why a majority may be reluctant to eliminate discrimination. The model
                  is also consistent with "reverse discrimination'' as a remedy against discrimination
                  since it may be necessary to decrease the welfare of the dominant group to achieve

                  strategy that identifies both the parameters of the model and the equilibrium chosen
                  by the economic agents is developed and empirically implemented. A comparison between
                  the equilibria that were selected in the economy over time and the other potential
                  equilibria reveals that the decline in wage inequality experienced in the U.S. economy
                  in the last thirty years cannot be attributed to changes in the equilibrium selection.

                  of workers, we show that discrimination is sustainable in equilibrium, even if the
                  corresponding model with a single group of workers has a unique equilibrium. An affirmative
                  action policy consisting of a quota may ``fail'' in the sense that there still may
                  be equilibria where groups are treated differently. However, the incentives to invest
                  for agents in the discriminated group are improved by affirmative action if the initial
                  equilibrium is the most discriminatory equilibrium in the model without the policy.
                  The welfare effects are ambiguous. We demonstrate that it is possible that the policy
                  makes the intended beneficiaries worse off: even if the starting point is the most
                  discriminatory equilibrium the expected payoff may decrease for all agents in the target
