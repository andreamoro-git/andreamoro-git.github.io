This chapter surveys the theoretical literature on statistical discrimination
and affirmative action. This literature suggests different explanations for the existence
and persistence of group inequality. This survey highlights such differences and describes
in these contexts the effects of color-sighted and color-blind affrmative action
policies, and the efficiency implications of discriminatory outcomes
