In jury trials in the U.S., the defense and the prosecution can exercise a limited
number of peremptory challenges to exclude jurors they deem unfit to be objective.
This institution is sometimes perceived to cause minorities to be under-represented in
juries. I use data from trials against Black defendants in Mississippi to estimate a model
of jury selection where the defense and prosecution strategically choose which jurors to
exclude from the jury. I match moments of trial outcomes and jurorsâ€™ challenges by
the defense and prosecution. Using the parameter estimates, I assess counterfactuals
to compare various aspects of the selection procedures. I compare the The Strike and
Replace procedure, which presents potential jurors one-by-one to the parties, with the
Struck procedure, presenting all potential jurors before the parties exercise vetoes. Re-
sults show that Struck more effectively excludes extremely biased jurors but leads to
a worse representation of minorities and higher conviction rates of Black defendants.
In all procedures, granting more challenges to the parties favors the prosecution and
significantly increases conviction rates of Black defendants.
