            We simulate a spatial behavioral model of the
                  diffusion of an infection to understand the role of
                  geographical characteristics: city size, density,
                  distribution of initial outbreaks, movement of agents.
                  We show that several invariance properties of the SIR model with respect to these variables do not hold
                  when agents are placed in a two dimensional space. Local herd immunity plays a fundamental role in changing the dynamics of the
                  infection. We also show that geographical factors affect how
                  behavioral responses affect the epidemics. We derive relevant implications for the estimation of  epidemiological models with panel data from several geographical units.
