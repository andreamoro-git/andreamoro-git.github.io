We test if firms statistically discriminate workers based on race when employer learning is asymmetric.
Using data from the NLSY79, we find evidence of asymmetric employer learning.
In addition, employers statistically discriminate against non-college
educated black workers at time of hiring. We also find that employers
directly observe most of the productivity of college graduates at
hiring and learn very little over time about these workers.
