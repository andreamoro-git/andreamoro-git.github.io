  We study a general class of models with social interactions that might display multiple equilibria. We
  propose an estimation procedure for these models and evaluate its efficiency and computational
  feasibility relative to different approaches taken to the curse of dimensionality implied
  by the multiplicity. Using data on smoking among teenagers, we implement the proposed
  estimation procedure to understand how group interactions affect health-related choices.
  Wefind that interaction effects are strong both at the school level and at the smaller
  friends-network level. Multiplicity of equilibria is pervasive at the estimated parameter
  values, and equilibrium selection accounts for about 15 percent of the observed smoking
  behavior. Counterfactuals show that student interactions, surprisingly, reduce smoking
  by approximately 70 percent with respect to the equilibrium smoking that would occur
  without interactions.
