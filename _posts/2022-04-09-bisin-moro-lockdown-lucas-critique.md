We extend a Spatial-SIR model of the diffusion of an infection to include heterogeneous agents interacting socially in three different types of location every day: City, School/Work, and Home. Contagion-risk averse agents respond behaviorally to the diffusion of the epidemic by limiting their social interactions. Firms also respond, by allowing employees to work remotely depending on their productivity.
We study the effects of several non-pharmaceutical intervention on epidemic dynamics, e.g. selective lockdowns.
Simulations illustrate how the network structure generates
local herd immunities along socio-demographic dimensions,
affecting policy outcomes.
Finally, substantiating a "Lucas critique" argument, we assess the cost
of naive policies ignoring the behavioral responses of agents and firms.
